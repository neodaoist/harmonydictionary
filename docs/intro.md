## What is the Harmony Dictionary?

The **Harmony Dictionary** is a helpful resource for applying tonal harmony in your music composition.

It is organized into 3 sections:
1. Alphabet -- scale degrees of all major and minor keys
2. Vocabulary -- chords for harmonizing each of the scale degrees, whether in Soprano or Bass
3. Grammar -- chord progressions for harmonizing a number of scale degrees in succession

You can think of XYZ as ABC.
